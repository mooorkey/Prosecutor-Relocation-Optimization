# Prosecutor Relocation Optimization
This repository contains a journey of my graduation/final year project called "Prosecutor Relocation Optimization".
Basicly it is a job assignment problem but with additional constraints. 
To solve the problem, I choose 2 popular optimization algorithm including "Branch and Bound" and "Genetic Algorithm" to study, compare, and optimize.
